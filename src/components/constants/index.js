    description: "<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">The following account was stumbled upon by a hot-air balloonist near the recently created Haridwar Space Station in northern India. It sheds some light on the chain of events which led up to the replacement of an entire city by a patch of sky in the year 2020.&nbsp;</p></br><p>However, we make no claims regarding the veracity of this document. Reader discretion is advised:&nbsp;<br /><br /><br /></p></br><p>The tree was growing upside down. There was no doubt it anymore.&nbsp;</p></br><p>No one knew what had caused this sudden shift in the tree&rsquo;s directional preferences. The closest we could come to recognizing a triggering incident was the visit of a municipality official to the tree a couple of days before it decided to do a headstand.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The official had come with a notepad, a roll of measuring tape, and two surly workmen with axes in their hands. He had taken measurements of the tree&rsquo;s girth and its distance from the road and our houses. A few of my eternally curious neighbors had learned by hovering in his general vicinity that he was working for the latest Devbhoomi Beautification Drive.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Devbhoomi, i.e. the land of gods, i.e. Haridwar, my humble city.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Every few years, around the time when city officials and politicians have to deposit the fee for their children studying abroad in fancy schools, or when their spouses need a new car, Haridwar undergoes a Beautification Drive.&nbsp;</p></br><p>It is impossible to predict exactly what the next drive will involve, but there are a few things which can generally be expected.</p></br><p>For example, to start with, as many trees as possible are chopped down to provide wood to the builders and contractors who are friends with the right people. The traffic routes are restricted, and diverted, and transformed to look like loopy crayon drawings of a child on the wall of a newly-painted house. Perfectly good roads are torn down to be laid out again while roads with as many, and as large, craters as the surface of the moon are left well alone like precious historical artifacts to be treasured until the end of time.&nbsp;</p></br><p>A couple of days after the new roads have been laid out, it is realized that the plumbing which needed to be repaired has not been repaired.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The new roads are torn out again to right this wrong. But, after the plumbing has been done and the roads have been laid down again it is discovered that the new road is 5.7 inches less wider than it is supposed to be, and the budgets are re-proportioned, and the road is torn out again, along with any remaining trees.&nbsp;</p></br><p>This kafkaesque cycle of corruption and incompetence continues until the Beautification Drive is abruptly declared a success and comes to an end until it begins again.&nbsp;</p></br><p>But anyway, not to digress too much, the tree was growing upside down.&nbsp;</p></br><p>It was one of the three very old, almost ancient, trees in front of my house, in the quieter part of the city. The triumvirate had stood there long before shops, apartments, temples, and schools came to settle down at a safe distance from the city&rsquo;s popular tourist hotspots.&nbsp;</p></br><p>For all anyone knew, the trees might have stood there since King Daksha, father-in-law of the Hindu god Shiva, had held court in the same neighborhood a thousand years ago.&nbsp;</p></br><p>According to the old stories, Daksha was responsible for the suicide of his daughter, and Shiva&rsquo;s wife, Sati. As a punishment Shiva beheaded him, but later forgave him and brought him back to life by attaching a goat&rsquo;s head to his stump. It&rsquo;s a good thing there were no Christians around to see that, or they might have mistaken Daksha for Satan, their own cosmic villain.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Apparently, Shiva had a thing for beheading people and then attaching mismatched heads to their bodies when he felt merciful&ndash;he did it at another time with his son Ganesh and an elephant&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The point is that strange things have a history of happening in our neighborhood. Maybe they had only taken a thousand-year hiatus.&nbsp;</p></br><p>But anyway, not to go off on mythological tangents, the tree was growing upside down.&nbsp;</p></br><p>It was first noticed by Jagannath, the garage-owner who operates his open garage under the same tree and hangs many things on the tree&rsquo;s large tree trunk.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Deflated tires, car doors which have come off their hinges, miscellaneous tubes, pipes, and extra-large wrenches, are all hung on the large iron spikes he nailed into the tree&rsquo;s trunk years ago. He could have been an executioner if he had been Roman and if crucifixions were still a popular way of executing trees as well as messiahs.</p></br><p>Anyway, not to switch tracks halfway down the trail, two days after the municipality man&rsquo;s visit, Jagan noticed the tree had shed all its leaves overnight.&nbsp;</p></br><p>When he started to sweep them away with Rajkumar, the sweeper who comes to collect our garbage every morning, he found that some of the leaves at the tree&rsquo;s foot were standing their ground and refused to come away with the brooms.&nbsp;</p></br><p>He realized it was so because these leaves had sprouted up overnight at the tree&rsquo;s roots. On the other hand, what had been the tree&rsquo;s branches were now much thinner and more sinewy than any branches in the world. The longer ones had even extended themselves into the water tank on my house&rsquo;s terrace to make up for the tree&rsquo;s groundwater supply.&nbsp;</p></br><p>By afternoon the news had spread all around the neighborhood and people had gathered around the tree with mobile phones, holy red threads, earthen lamps, garlands of marigold flowers, and pots of milk.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Some of the women established a 2-feet-high idol of Shiva at the tree in an attempt to chase out whatever spirit had ssessed it and turned its mind to rebelliousness.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Rajkumar, the sweeper, asked people not to gather together, keeping in mind the government&rsquo;s advice to maintain social-distancing during the Coronavirus pandemic. He was shushed away and sent off by people who declared that a man from the chamar caste had no place near this site of a miracle.&nbsp;</p></br><p>A large white cow with a distinguishing splash of black on its forehead represented the animals at this gathering by chomping on the tree&rsquo;s leaves. Those who suspected that the upside-down tree could be the manifestation of a god promptly chased away the cow before it could make a decision about this new taste.</p></br><p>I have thought many times since then that if only we had been less enthusiastic yesterday much of what came to happen may not have happened.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Maybe, in our curiosity we went to the see the tree, to touch it, to worship it, to put up its pictures on Instagram, and when we returned back to our shops and homes we carried back with us the pollen of its upside-downness, and this pollen then was fertilized in us just like the Coronavirus in those poor Chinese pangolins and bats.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Curiosity did kill the cat, I suppose, but cats have nine lives and we humans only have the one.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Incidentally, the Egyptian goddess Bast is believed to have the head of a cat on her otherwise human body. One can&rsquo;t help but wonder if she ran across Shiva sometime during her eternal life.</p></br><p>But anyway, not to hitchhike a ride on some mythological rocket and fly off into the sunset, the crowd which had gathered around the upturned tree also included my next-door neighbor, Pandit Mishra, a jobless man who sometimes moonlighted as an astrologer in the local newspaper.&nbsp;</p></br><p>As always, Mishra did the most idiotic thing possible. He informed his friends at the newspaper about the natural wonder blooming in his own front yard.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The journalists, however, were busy covering the way the rest of the world at large had turned upside down when faced with a pandemic.&nbsp;</p></br><p>For the first time in history, India had trumped the USA in a scientific endeavour by spraying people with disinfectants much before the American President advised the Americans to drink bleach for ridding themselves of the virus.&nbsp;</p></br><p>In Bengal, a man had held a party with cocktails based in cow-piss instead of alcohol.</p></br><p>In temples of capitalism such as California and London, homeless people suddenly found themselves being carted off to nice, comfortable hotels instead of jails and asylums.&nbsp;</p></br><p>All around the world, conservative families which had prided themselves on their ability to keep women in kitchens and bedrooms began sending out the same women to buy groceries while keeping the men safely tucked in bed under two layers of disinfectant, five surgical outfits, and an astronaut&rsquo;s suit.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The banks, instead of sending goons in formal clothes to people&rsquo;s houses for sucking them out for whatever they were worth, had started talking about giving their clients rebates on loans and more time to pay off their EMIs.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Even the governments, in a complete role reversal, seemed to have given up on mooching off their citizens and were beginning to consider an unthinkable thing: doing the work they had been elected to do.</p></br><p>Maybe our humble tree had decided to aim for hell instead of heaven not as a gesture of rebellion against its impending murder but simply as a matter of falling in line with rest of the world?</p></br><p>Anyway, not to get so lost in the bigger picture that we lose sight of our own little corner in it, a journalist and his cameraman were finally able to leave the serious business of hate-mongering and fake-news-peddling to their more talented colleagues for visiting our humble neighborhood the next day.</p></br><p>The first person they met was a middle-aged stranger in a safari suit who had settled on a folding stool near the tree sometime during the night.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The journalist asked him what he thought was happening here.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The cow who had munched on the tree&rsquo;s leaves yesterday sauntered towards them and the stranger petted it on its head thoughtfully.&nbsp;</p></br><p>He told the journalist that this was a super-secret mission of the Modi government to dig tunnels at zero cost for installing Super-Fast Bullet Trains that will ferry pilgrims to and fro from Haridwar.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The journalist loved this explanation, of course.&nbsp;</p></br><p>He opened his mouth to pose another question to the obviously intelligent man, but at that very moment the cow decided to clamp down its teeth on the stranger&rsquo;s hand. It had lost the taste of our trash-in-bright-polythene-bags, it seemed, in favor of fleshier alternatives.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The journalist&rsquo;s white kurta was sprayed with blood.&nbsp;</p></br><p>He watched horrified, along with the rest of us in our balconies and shops, as the cow relished the stranger&rsquo;s hand with the thoughtful munching that is characteristic to cows, instead of the snap-and-swallow generally expected from carnivore beasts. &nbsp;</p></br><p>Ibrahim, a young mechanic who worked at Jagan&rsquo;s garage, rushed to save the situation while the journalist filmed the incident with much hand-wringing and outrage. When the usual shooing away did not work to chase off the cow, Ibrahim took off a wrench from the tree&rsquo;s trunk and drove it through the cow&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The bovine gave the world a last red-toothed grin before falling down to the ground, and then, of course, died.&nbsp;</p></br><p>An ambulance was called to cart away the profusely bleeding stranger who had gotten his 15 minutes of fame. A police van came to take away Ibrahim for killing the holy animal.&nbsp;</p></br><p>By now the whole neighborhood was finding it more and more difficult to comprehend what was happening around us.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Patience was running low, and so when the journalist, unfazed by the carnivorous cow and its murder, tried to interview us about how we felt about the recent incidents, he was uncermenously reminded of his utter uselessness in the face of crisis and booed away with the choicest abuses.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Before slinking away, standing beyond the range of our shoes and slippers, he told us we would face dire consequences for heckling him. But we took no notice of him; there were bigger things to worry about.&nbsp;</p></br><p>As the branches of our upside down tree bore deeper and farther into the ground, the ripples of its upside-downness began expanding like ripples in a pond. No one knew how to cope with them and get back to our regular lives of comfortable indifference and apathy. It drove us nuts.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Some people worried that the idol of Shiva that had been placed yesterday at the tree&rsquo;s foot must be hungry by now and milk was fetched from cows who still were herbivores.</p></br><p>It turned out, however, that even the gods were in on the cruel trick being played on us.&nbsp;</p></br><p>When a woman reverentially raised a glass of milk to&nbsp; the idol&rsquo;s mouth, it opened its mouth and puked out a stream of rancid milk and bile. The shocked woman backed away from the abomination and raised a hand to cover her nose and mouth.&nbsp;</p></br><p>For hours the idol kept vomiting out everything it had silently swallowed over the years. Every few minutes it would pour out from its heart also streams of blood that had been spilt in its name.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The stench was so bad that some people began praying to Shiva to behead them and then fix them up with Lord Voldemort&rsquo;s noseless head when he felt more merciful.</p></br><p>As the night grew darker, people began returning to their homes, silent and worried.&nbsp;</p></br><p>We went to sleep hungry&ndash;because the fire in our gas stoves no longer had any heat&ndash;and thirsty&ndash;because when we turned on the taps, all they did was make a strange sucking sound.</p></br><p>The next morning, as soon as I put my feet on the ground, I knew something was off with my body. I went out to the balcony and the very act of walking felt like I was doing it for the first time.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Anyway, not to nosedive straight into an existential crisis, I made myself a practical cup of coffee and came out to the balcony.&nbsp;</p></br><p>By the roadside a few feet from my house, Mr. Sharma, a sweetshop owner, was talking earnestly to Rajkumar, the sweeper. It looked like society had decided to mimic nature in turning on its head: Sharma-ji, a Brahmin, was asking Rajkumar, a Chamar, to perform a pooja for appeasing whichever deities our neighborhood had offended.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Rajkumar agreed to that sweetly enough but when Sharma-ji tried to seal the deal by shaking his hand, he got offended by this violation of social-distancing and walked away in a huff.&nbsp;</p></br><p>A fortunate outcome of this incident was that by some strange mental association between honest workers, Rajkumar reminded me of the gardener in&nbsp;<em>Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights.&nbsp;</em></p></br><p>So, following the reasoning of Rushdie&rsquo;s levitating Geronimo Manezes, I picked up a page from the newspaper and performed his experiment. As I had suspected, the paper passed underneath the soles of my feet like a hot knife through butter, or like a sheet of paper through thin air.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The implication, as difficult as it was to process, was simple enough to understand: my feet were not touching the ground, I was floating a few millimeters above it.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Now, it has been a few hours since my discovery and I am not alone in experiencing a reversal of gravity. The whole neighborhood has followed in my wake.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Our tree is trying to reach hell, and we are going to heaven. Unless, those two theological concepts have also decided to switch places and we are on our way to cauldrons full of hot oil and mountain treks that never end?&nbsp;</p></br><p>We are floating away from earth in slow upward spirals like so many oversized balloons, and we are as afraid as Harry&rsquo;s Aunt Marge was when she found herself in a similar situation.&nbsp;</p></br><p>It was a pity that the journalist we heckled was not famous enough, or we too could have been banned from taking flights, thus avoiding this unfortunate situation. Or maybe he was even more influential than Mr. Goswami and he had got us banned from earth itself?</p></br><p>We watch from above as the upside-downness extends itself further and the Ganga river begins to flow back home towards the Gangotri glacier. As the water level drops, many skeletons become visible on the river bed.</p></br><p>And now, what is that&mdash;what in the name of Shiva is happening to the other two trees, the two as-yet-blameless brothers of our green and brown black sheep?&nbsp;</p></br><p>But, ah, forget it. Forget it. Apr&egrave;s moi le d&eacute;luge, no? Let these worldly matters not distract us anymore from what is staring us in the face: our impending death.&nbsp;</p></br><p>The air is thin up here and when it goes into the lungs it feels as sharp as a razor blade on the cheek. It is so cold.&nbsp; I would like nothing more than to keep writing and make sure that people know how the world is turned upside, but I&rsquo;m afraid I am feeling extremely lightheaded and must now bring this account to conclusion before the pen slips away from my han</p>"

    description: "<p>Kalua listened to his belly groan with hunger.</p></br><p>He mopped at the beads of sweat on his forehead with a gamcha1 and peeked over his wife&rsquo;s shoulder into a pot wherein she was cooking some nameless concoction.</p></br><p>It was a homogeneous sludge, the color of mucus, with a few pieces of onion here and there, trying to drown themselves. The sight of it was enough to dull his appetite a little. But, to make things worse, there wasn&rsquo;t nearly enough of it to sneak some off to Safeda.</p></br><p>His friend would just have to go hungry again.</p></br><p>He looked at Gudiya, his little sister, reading the scraps of a newspaper in a corner, and felt guilty about thinking of Safeda when he was failing to provide enough even for his family. Only last month, Gudiya had fallen sick and the doctor had advised Kalua to include meat in her diet at least once a week to make up for protein deficiency.</p></br><p>Despite this guilt, however, Safeda was also important to Kalua.</p></br><p>Like many other people in the world, Kalua had found his best-friend at his workplace. Only, the workplace happened to be a gutter, and the best-friend happened to be an alligator.</p></br><p>Kalua never knew how Safeda came to be there, only that it was hurt and starved when they first met, and so Kalua fed it his own lunch and applied cool mud on its bruises.</p></br><p>Because of the grey color of its skin, which Kalua thought unusual, he named it Safeda. The absence of sunlight in the creature&rsquo;s life might have had something to do with it. Or, maybe it was just an anomaly. But in any case, the name&rsquo;s contrast with his own amused Kalua to no end.</p></br><p>That was twelve years ago.</p></br><p>Kalua had not been married then and Gudiya hadn&rsquo;t even been born. In those days, he used to go into the sewers only when his father&rsquo;s cough was exceptionally bad. He hated every second of it and swore daily to himself that he would become anything but a jamadaar2.</p></br><p>That, of course, was before the world had explained the inescapability of his caste to him, and before his parents had died of tuberculosis, leaving him all alone to bring up his baby sister.</p></br><p>&lsquo;Ae, Gudiya, what are you doing reading in this bad evening light? You&rsquo;ll ruin your eyes&rsquo;, he called out to the girl whom he had managed to keep away from the sewers, and had even sent to school.<br />Up till now, at least.</p></br><p>Gudiya was now close to 10 but looked like she was only 5-6 years old. It wasn&rsquo;t unusual in their neighborhood though&mdash;malnutrition made the kids all look younger there than they actually were, and the adults older.</p></br><p>Gudiya looked at him and threw aside the newspaper scrap she was reading. &lsquo;Went to the butcher in the afternoon, but he had already gutted and skinned everything. He asked me to come only when my cut had healed completely.&rsquo;</p></br><p>After her school, Gudiya often went to help the neighborhood butcher in his shop and he tossed her a few coins for it every now and then. Two days ago, she had cut herself on the side of her hand while slicing a piece of meat. It was an ugly gash, and Kalua had tied a clean piece of cloth around it, hoping that it would not get infected.</p></br><p>The butcher, Kalua knew, had sent Gudiya away not out of concern for her but because he did not want to risk her blood making the food impure for his customers.</p></br><p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s okay, beta3, don&rsquo;t worry about it. This is just a temporary situation. Things will go back to normal soon&rsquo;, Kalua told her with a conviction he did not possess himself.</p></br><p>His wife joined them and put the cooking pot between them, holding it carefully with rags in each of her hands. She rotated it a few times on the circumference of its bottom, as though trying to pull off some magic trick that would turn that mixture of water, flour, and salt into real food.</p></br><p>There were only two spoons in the pot.</p></br><p>&lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t you eating, bhabhi4?&rsquo;, Gudiya asked.</p></br><p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have something later. You two eat now, and please&ndash;take care to wipe off everything from the pot.&rsquo;</p></br><p>But, there was nothing to be had later, Kalua knew that well enough. It would be a week tomorrow since either of them had gone to work. This muck in the pot, this was the last of their rations.</p></br><p>He got up so quickly that his head swam a little and his stomach growled in protest.</p></br><p>&lsquo;I am sorry, I remembered just now&ndash;Varshney-ji had asked me to visit his house today. He wants me to help unload some stuff from his terrace. I&rsquo;ll just go there and come back in some time, okay?&rsquo;</p></br><p>&lsquo;But your dinner?&rsquo;, his wife asked, not meeting his eyes.</p></br><p>&lsquo;You two finish it off. I&rsquo;ll have some chai-nashta with Varshney-Ji.&rsquo;</p></br><p>Kalua did not wait for her response, but at the door he paused for just a moment to look at her moving slowly to sit beside Gudiya. He came out of the shanty and took a few steps to the right so that they wouldn&rsquo;t see him standing there.</p></br><p>Then, he let out a long, heavy sigh. It was a sigh that can crush those who hear it, and must therefore, only be released once you are at a safe distance from the people you love.</p></br><p>His wife must have seen through his lie. She knew full well that he wouldn&rsquo;t even be allowed to sit on the curb of a baniya&rsquo;s house, let alone invited inside and asked to handle their possessions. Not in a million years&ndash;a pamphlet of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan fluttered near his feat and Kalua spat at it in disgust&ndash;not after a thousand more Swachh Bharat Abhiyaans had come and gone, could that happen in their world.</p></br><p>The only place Kalua, or anyone from his caste, could go to in the house of someone from an upper caste, like Varshney-Ji, was the latrine. Straight in, straight out, and a few coins dropped on their palms at the door without a word exchanged.</p></br><p>Kalua and his kin were like elves. Shit-scooping, latterine-scraping elves. Invisible and inaudible to everyone else.</p></br><p>But still, even while wading through the literal and figurative shit in their lives, they had been going on, one way or another. Until a fortnight ago, when a saffron-robed rally had snaked its way through the Jamadaar Basti5 with bright posters that most of the residents couldn&rsquo;t read.</p></br><p>Fat government men came in that rally with their sweat-shined faces, their saccharine smiles, their noses scrunched up against the smell of Kalua and his people. The fat men declared proudly on their loudspeakers that no one would be required anymore to lower themselves into a sewer. If anybody asked them to do so, the government would penalize that person and put him in jail.</p></br><p>They were told that the credit for all this went to their Chief Minister and the Prime Minister, both of whom cared deeply for all Hindus, including dalits like Kalua and his neighbors.</p></br><p>The fat men waved to the people from their vehicles and were careful not to shake hands with them. Among much fanfare, with satisfied smiles, they went out the same way they had come in and breathed freely once more in the clean air outside the slum.</p></br><p>As Kalua, his wife, and their friends realized a couple of hours later, the government men had forgotten to mention what would be their new employment, now that this one was illegal.</p></br><p>And so it was that the slum had begun to crawl towards starvation. They had held up until now on the tidbits saved over their lifetimes. A few had managed to get odd jobs here and there, but no one really wanted to employ a jamadaar in their shop or house, or anywhere that there would be a chance of being touched by them.</p></br><p>Kalua wondered where he could go to pass the time while his family had their dinner and decided upon the only place that felt a little like home. A horrible home, true, but still a home, with the comfort of an old friend.</p></br><p>Maybe he would also be able to catch a few rats down there and feed them to Safeda.</p></br><p>***<br />&lsquo;Do you think bhaiya6 will be able to get some work today?&rsquo;, Gudiya asked her bhabhi, back in the house.</p></br><p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, of course, he&rsquo;ll find some work. Don&rsquo;t you worry about it.&rsquo;</p></br><p>But, Gudiya did worry about it.</p></br><p>Just as she worried about the fact that her brother had not been able to feed his pet in the last two weeks and it was making him even sadder than usual. Gudiya had never met this pet, but she knew its name was Safeda because it had slipped out of Kalua once, though he had not noticed it.</p></br><p>Gudiya liked to imagine that Safeda was a fluffy white dog like one of her classmates had at her house. Only, her bhaiya kept it in the sewer instead of the house. To a 10-year-old&rsquo;s mind, this did not seem all that strange because she knew that bhabhi would never have allowed bhaiya to keep the dog in the house, not when they never had enough food or money even for the three of them.</p></br><p>Like most kids in the neighborhood, Gudiya knew that the last couple of weeks had been especially bad for everyone.</p></br><p>It was evident in the way that people she had known all her life to wake up at dawn and go to work now spent their days sitting desolately in front of their shacks, waiting for something to happen. They reminded Gudiya the days when she was a toddler and had kept waiting for the ice-cream man who, somehow, never went through their gully.</p></br><p>The worst of it all was the change in her bhaiya.</p></br><p>No matter how bad things got in the past, he had always had a joke tucked away somewhere in his head, ready to be called and released to laughs when things began to look too grim. He did things instead of waiting for them to happen. Like, when Gudiya had waited, and waited, and waited, for the ice-cream man, he had gone out one day and had brought back three orange ice-creams from God knew where.</p></br><p>These few days, however, he hardly talked to her at all.</p></br><p>Some days while taking a bath, Gudiya moved her fingers slowly underwater in the bucket and watched them for minutes on end. That&rsquo;s how her brother looked these days. Like a man living underwater in his head; walking around in a bubble of vacuum and space where no one could really reach him.</p></br><p>Except for his pet, maybe. It might cheer him up if Gudiya brought it to the house and surprised him. Anyway, she was sure that it would cheer her up!</p></br><p>So, after her bhabhi had put her to bed, and went to sleep herself, Gudiya put on the robe that Kalua wore while going into the sewers. He had made it by stitching together discarded polythene bags.</p></br><p>It was too large for her, of course, and fluttered behind her like a superhero&rsquo;s cape. The multicolored polythene bags shimmered in the weak light leaking inside from a streetlight and looked like an undisciplined rainbow.</p></br><p>She also put on Kalua&rsquo;s yellow safety helmet and his brown leather boots.</p></br><p>Quietly, Gudiya stole out of the house and closed down the door behind her. She walked up to the open manhole down which she had seen her bhaiya disappear many times.</p></br><p>Then, with a look at the moon overhead, she lowered herself down into the darkness, down the iron rungs of the sewer.</p></br><p>***</p></br><p>This manhole into which Gudiya had lowered herself was connected to other manholes in the city through large pipes constituting Aligarh&rsquo;s sewage network. As Gudiya descended further down the hole, she could hear the water splashing at the bottom and her guts contracted a little with the inherent fear of invisible damp things.</p></br><p>The stench of sewage was overwhelming and made her feel a little faint.</p></br><p>To steel herself, she looked up at the circle of the night sky through the open manhole, but it looked so far away suddenly that she thought it better to concentrate on her descent.</p></br><p>Finally, after a few moments, or minutes, or millenia, her boots found mushy ground.</p></br><p>A small part of her mind wondered how a dog could live in a place where the water came up to her ankles. But before she could give it a thought, there was a sound of water splashing nearby.</p></br><p>It sounded like she wasn&rsquo;t alone. Someone else was also taking a night walk here. Or, maybe it was just the sound of her heart tumbling out of her mouth and falling into the sewer.</p></br><p>Gudiya moved forward, putting one foot after the other, like a little soldier in large boots. Her polythene robe made an almost-but-not-quite-silent slithering sound behind her.</p></br><p>A few more steps and the darkness would be absolute. Gudiya pressed a little wire in the helmet and the bulb-battery combination that Kalua had taped together jumped to action.</p></br><p>The feeble light threw long shadows on the sewer&rsquo;s walls and Gudiya saw that the pipe turned sharply to the left a little way off in the distance.</p></br><p>Again, she heard the sound of water splashing. Despite an instinctive urge to run back with her tail tucked between her legs, she kept walking in the direction of the sound. And then, as she stood at the pipe&rsquo;s turn she saw in front of her a man tossing something into the water at his feet.</p></br><p>No, not into the water. Tossing something to a creature on the ground.</p></br><p>A creature that definitely was not the fluffy white dog from Pinky&rsquo;s imagination. White teeth glinted in an evil grin at her. A pair of dull green eyes with black slits for pupils measured the flesh on her bones. In the wavering light of Gudiya&rsquo;s helmet-bulb, she saw a ripple of excitement pass through the monster&rsquo;s dirty rubbery-white body.</p></br><p>The man standing beside it, startled by the light, turned to face Gudiya. It was her bhaiya, of course, and how shocked he looked!</p></br><p>The dead rats dangled by their tails in his hand like the balls of the neighborhood butcher, who had shown them to Gudiya last week and had given her 20 rupees just for touching them.</p></br><p>She looked from her brother to the monster at his feet and she opened her mouth to scream but found the sound missing. She closed her fists so tightly at her sides that the cloth Kalua had tied as a bandage came off and two tiny drops of blood dropped down from the open cut into the water.</p></br><p>The starving alligator, half-blind, but no less a predator for it, caught the whiff of fresh blood like a drowning man catches a rope thrown at him out of the rescue ship.</p></br><p>***</p></br><p>Kalua&rsquo;s mind tried to make sense of the situation and failed irrevocably. His thoughts came to him only as snatches of the self-evident truth. Must do something. Quickly.</p></br><p>His friend, whose primary trait in the last twelve years had been laziness, was now paddling furiously towards his sister, who stood rooted to the spot.</p></br><p>A large stone brick, dislodged long ago from the sewer&rsquo;s wall, was lying near Safeda&rsquo;s tail, and Kalua picked it up.</p></br><p>&lsquo;Gudiya! GUDIYA! Run. NOW!&rsquo;</p></br><p>But, Gudiya&rsquo;s eyes were locked on Safeda, as though hypnotized, and she looked like she could not even hear Kalua.</p></br><p>Kalua moved toward Safeda, stumbling in the water and almost falling down. In a couple of strides, however, he was near the alligator&rsquo;s head. Safeda turned to look at him and for a moment Kalua thought he could see the trace of human intelligence in the green eyes, a hesitation in moving towards Gudiya.</p></br><p>But, hunger is hunger.</p></br><p>It turned again towards Gudiya and with a flick of its tail almost hit Kalua, as if warning him to not meddle with its dinner.</p></br><p>Kalua raised the brick in his hand, stepped forward, and brought down its corner in Safeda&rsquo;s left eye. He wanted only to buy enough time to send Gudiya away, but it was as if the violence had unleashed something inside him which he did not know existed.</p></br><p>So, before Safeda could turn towards him, he crossed his leg over its back and brought the brick down once again. And then again, and again, until there was no movement left in the body and the light had gone out of Safeda&rsquo;s eyes. It felt a little like the final cleaning away of the shit that other people had flushed his way. Regular work, nothing odd. A frightened little giggle escaped Kalua&rsquo;s mouth at this thought.</p></br><p>He did not know what made his hand stop finally. Maybe, it happened when Gudiya managed to find her voice again.</p></br><p>&lsquo;Bhaiya, please. Enough&rsquo;</p></br><p>Her face looked so small, so fragile, in the half-light-half-shadow of the bulb in her helmet. It reminded him, strangely enough, of how little Safeda had been when he had found it starving in the sewer.</p></br><p>&lsquo;Come, let&rsquo;s go.&rsquo;</p></br><p>Kalua crossed his other leg over Safeda and took Gudiya by her hand.</p></br><p>He took one last look at the body of his friend before turning his back on it: an eyeball, dislodged from its socket, dangled from the destroyed face by a thin string of flesh. Even as he watched, the eyeball gave up to gravity and fell down to the sewer floor. &lsquo;Plop!&rsquo;</p></br><p>Kalua bent down for Gudiya to climb over his back and like that they walked to the manhole&rsquo;s iron rungs before they climbed out of it.</p></br><p>***</p></br><p>In her cot, tucked down by her brother, the monster in the sewer seemed little more than one of her regular nightmares to Gudiya.</p></br><p>With half-closed eyes she watched Kalua put on the polythene robe she had taken off&ndash;he had thrown his own in the street, blood-stained and grimy as it was&ndash;and pick something from the kitchen shelf before going to the door again.</p></br><p>Fear crept back into her heart. &lsquo;Where are you going, bhaiya? Come to sleep, please?&rsquo;</p></br><p>As he put the thing that he had picked up from the shelf into his pocket, Gudiya saw that it was the knife she took with her when she went to work at the butcher&rsquo;s shop.</p></br><p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, I&rsquo;ll be back up in no time at all&rsquo;, he said with a tired little smile. Then with a little hesitation, he added, &lsquo;And maybe tomorrow, we will have meat again for lunch. It&rsquo;ll be good for you, the doctor said.&rsquo;</p></br><p>***</p></br><p>Glossary:</p></br><p>1.

    description: "<p>Now we&rsquo;re walking on this empty street and you tell me how we&rsquo;re very much the same, how much our thoughts and choices match.</p></br><p>&lsquo;It has been just a month since I met you,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;and already I feel like I&rsquo;ve known you for years.&rsquo;</p></br><p>You said that on this same night five years ago and I laughed out loud then. I told you what a cheesy sentimentalist you are.</p></br><p>You looked straight into my eyes and said quietly, &lsquo;You feel like home.&rsquo;</p></br><p>Maybe that was the moment you sealed our fates together; I put a stamp on that seal when I kissed you in the next moment. Now I just nod and tell you that I feel the same way. I wish you would not say such things tonight. It will make what I am going to do so much more difficult.</p></br><p>This is one of the rare times when I have come back into a reality I have already been to, except for a few details of course; no two realities can ever be exactly the same. In a way, I am happy to be here &ndash; this is the reality, or dimension, whatever you may call it, where we first met.</p></br><p>I turn around once to look back at the softly lit caf&eacute; we have come from. You were eating tiramisu and I was sitting with a glass of wine in my hand. I sipped between your pauses and watched you, trying to learn every single line and every single movement of your face. The way you pick the tiniest morsels in every spoon so that it will last longer, the way you keep the cake in your mouth a moment longer than anyone else I know, so that the taste may fade away slower.</p></br><p>I replied without thought, almost mechanically: it is the same conversation we had five years ago, at the same table.</p></br><p>You have long, brown hair in this reality and I am still not used to it. Where I was up until a month ago, you had blue spiky hair and I had nicknamed you Pixie. That was a good month. At least until the last day when we were in your apartment and the curtains caught fire.</p></br><p>My guts clench as I remember the last words you always say to me: &lsquo;Until the next time, my love.&rsquo;</p></br><p>Why do you always say that? It isn&rsquo;t as if you know how true it is&hellip;</p></br><p>There is only one street lamp on this stretch of the road and the shadows of trees look like cobwebs around our feet. In one of the houses by the roadside somebody is playing an old song by Kishor Kumar.</p></br><p><em>Mere mehboob qayamat hogi, aaj ruswa teri galiyon mein mohabbat hogi&hellip;</em></p></br><p><em>My darling, there will be apocalypse today, love will be disgraced in your street</em><em>&hellip;</em></p></br><p>You pick up the tune and begin to hum. Everything fits together, eventually.</p>"

    description: "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s 2 a.m.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only drunkards, ghosts, and thieves stay up late in the night, Mother used to say while putting us to bed. Maybe parenthood had made her forget all about lovesick people, college students, and people with thoughts so heavy that sleep slips away the moment their head touches the pillow.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised either by such a lapse of memory&mdash;I never did see her do anything other than take care of her four children, of whom I was the youngest. Father was no different. He woke up at 6, went to the office, sat with his children to help them with their homework after returning from the office, and went to bed at 9.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When one of the other kids in our neighborhood failed his exams, or got caught kissing the tuition-teacher, Mother would smile with satisfaction and say, this is what happens to children whose parents go for matinee shows instead of staying home with them. Father would nod his head in proud agreement.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this day, since the day they first became parents, Mother and Father have never watched a movie at the cinema hall. But, they are respectable people and they have raised their children to be respectable people.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are not so different, I think than any other respectable people who decide for one reason or another, and mostly for no reason whatsoever, to have children. They stop being real people the moment they become parents&mdash;little bundles of mildly sentient flesh and bones take over their lives and never give up the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, I am not going to talk too much about my parents&mdash;that&rsquo;s not what you do when you are up at 2 a.m and wondering listlessly if you should jump off the balcony. Not unless your parents did something that scarred you for life, like run away with one of your friends from high school, maybe, or successfully convinced you for life that masturbation will blind you.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My parents tried and failed to achieve the latter, but the former really did happen to a girl I knew at school. Her father, the town postmaster, eloped with her best friend during our board exams. No one got their letters on time for almost a month afterward. No one cared much about that, however, because he had left ample gossip in his wake to make up for the lack of letters.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The postmaster&mdash;now that was a man whom having children had not changed all that much. Or maybe it had. We might find the truth about that in a story someone writes about him. This is not that story.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don&rsquo;t tell stories about small-town postmasters when you are wondering whether you will hit the ground head-first if you step off the ledge or whether you will split down the spine like a fat book bound in flesh, written in blood.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But stories about the father of gynecology&mdash;a certain Dr. Sims&mdash;now that&rsquo;s a different matter altogether. You can tell such stories while contemplating going gentle into the good night, especially if your pregnant wife is sleeping in the bedroom like mine is right now.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. J. Marion Sims was an American, for one thing, which makes his story more important than the story of any third-worlder, let alone an anonymous postmaster or a retired old couple. For another thing, if you were born at a hospital anytime in the last couple of centuries, you owe some credit to the good doctor.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit, or blame, depending on how much you have seen of the world, and how far up the food chain you have lived in it.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From where I am sitting right now, which is to say from the ledge of my balcony, I can see the inflated belly of my wife rise and fall calmly in the blue-green glow of the nightlight if I bend over backwards. She woke me up about half an hour ago when she tried to turn on her side and hit me in my groin. Not the best way to wake up, I can tell you that, but we can&rsquo;t really blame her. There are very few positions she can comfortably sleep in these days.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is looking forward to getting her body in its usual shape and nature, she told me before going to bed tonight, almost as much as she is looking forward to the baby. I nodded my head and thought about how in less than a month we will depend on the work of Dr. Sims for the safe delivery of our child.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He developed most of the surgical instruments which are used in gynecology today, you see, working out of a barn, back in the 19th century. That&rsquo;s why they call him the father of surgical gynecology. His wife and kids must have been so proud of him. As are the rest of Americans evidently, if his statues in eminent universities are anything to go by.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I often find my thoughts turning to him on sleepless nights lately. It has been happening ever since I read an article about how he came about his discoveries. It was through a rigorous and painful process of trial-and-error, it seems. Rigorous for him, painful for others.&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dear old Dr. Sims, it appears, had Black slave women sit on his table and bend over on their knees while he poked around in their lady-parts with his tools to see what worked and what did not. The slaves were not given any anesthesia, of course, because Mr. Sims believed that Black people did not feel pain.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can imagine Dr. Sims now, his head held high, walking down to the church with his wife and children on Sundays. He was a respectable man, and I&rsquo;m sure he raised his children to be respectable people too. I can&rsquo;t help but picture him in my head as my father&mdash; monochrome version, no mustache.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When my parents visited us at this new house they were put off by the balcony because whoever built the house did not think it necessary to install a railing or a banister here. They have been outspoken about the need for high railings ever since my classmate, the postmaster&rsquo;s embarrassed daughter, attempted suicide by jumping from her terrace.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She did not die, but she broke the bones in her left hip and right wrist. She works at the post-office now and I met her last year when I went home for Diwali. She was shopping with her daughter at the market and she made the little girl touch my feet and say namaste with folded hands.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well-mannered girl, I thought, a girl being raised to be a respectable person.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I remembered that her grandfather, the postmaster, was a man who cared very much about good manners. If we ever passed him by on the street without pausing to touch his feet he would make it a point to send a complaint-note along with the next letter to our homes. He also had a peculiar habit of spanking their bottoms when girls bent down to reach his toes. Sometimes he did it to us boys too.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SWAT! his hand would come on our behinds, as if to kill some invisible mosquito, and he would give a dry chuckle by way of blessings. There were rumors about some other things he liked doing to children, but no one ever complained&mdash;it would have been too embarrassing to go up to your respectable parents and tell them that the postmaster touched you in strange ways.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyway, like I was saying, for the duration of their stay at our house my parents made sure they reminded us every day what absolute idiots we had been to buy a house that did not have high railings on the balcony. I thought about that a minute ago, as I walked back and forth on the ledge where the railing should have been and where instead is only a railing-shaped, risky nothingness. I looked again through the bedroom door at my peacefully sleeping wife.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I had slipped, just as I turned away from her and sighed meaningfully, this would have become a perfect late-night story. Idiot husband contemplates suicide, looks at his beloved wife, changes his mind about dying, and then dies all the same&mdash;a perfect ending if you have a taste for cynicism and irony.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I did not slip.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I faced forward and looked at the world sprawled out in front of me. A tree that used to obstruct some of the view was chopped down last week. The world may have suffered a slight loss of oxygen but I am more far-sighted now. I could see some people dancing away the night on their roof in the distance. Sleepless, hormone-addled college students maybe.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at them I felt like if I took a step, and then one more, I might be able to walk through the air and join them, shed away the cobwebs of my slumber-years on the way. Or, maybe it would be better to take a mad leap and fly away into the open sky? Aren&rsquo;t people always extolling the benefits of taking a leap of faith?</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But I chose neither of the two ways. My cinema-abstaining parents did not raise us to be dreamy fools. I stepped down from the ledge and looked down at Mr. Rao&rsquo;s terrace on which my head would have spilled out my brains if I had indeed taken a leap of faith.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Rao, our 60-something next-door neighbor, served in the army once upon a time and won two medals for showing extraordinary courage. He showed them to us proudly after inviting us for tea, the day we moved in. Mrs. Rao made and served the tea&mdash;a grey-haired, round-faced, 5-feet-high lady clad from head to toe in a fluffy cotton saree; she encouraged us to keep coming over, considering they don&rsquo;t see as much of young people as they want to. Both of their boys are settled in the USA and are able to visit them only during the Christmas holidays.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We promised we would not let them want for company.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A genial old couple, our Mr. and Mrs. Rao, quietly living out their silver years with each other. The pinnacle of marriage&rsquo;s success as an institution. Except for their bathroom, maybe.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For you see, Mrs. Rao slips in the bathroom all too frequently, and then makes a point of telling everyone she meets the next day that that&rsquo;s how she got the bruises. If anyone wonders why such accidents happen only at night and why she keeps screaming and crying for hours at a time, that&rsquo;s not Mrs. Rao&rsquo;s problem. In any case, no one has voiced such questions to her; no respectable person wants to meddle in other people&rsquo;s domestic affairs.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Rao really hates his wife or would ever cause her any lasting harm. She is just like the cotton mattress on his bed to him&mdash;from time to time he brings up this mattress to the terrace and beats it senseless with a stick. Then he hangs it on the wall to dry.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turns the mattress good as new, this treatment does, he tells me conspiratorially each time I see him going at it, and keeps one comfortable at night.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mr. Sims, our surgical pioneer, must have thought the same way about the black women he was experimenting on. A few black eggs broken to make nice, fluffy white omelets&mdash;what could be the harm in that?</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s close to 3 o&rsquo;clock now and the thought has crossed my mind that I should perhaps retire back to bed and put off this&mdash;whatever this is&mdash;for another sleepless night. But, something keeps stopping me. There&rsquo;s something inescapable about climbing back into one&rsquo;s bed late at night; you know you won&rsquo;t be able to escape it again until the next morning, and then it will be the same day all over again.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Groundhogs Day. Dr. Sims Day. Mr. Rao Day. Mrs. Rao Day. So it goes. So it goes, as Vonnegut said. But what if you cannot take it going on so anymore?</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To tell you the truth, these systemic uglinesses&mdash;against women, or Blacks, or trees, or Muslims&mdash;don&rsquo;t really keep me up at night. They don&rsquo;t make me look again and again at my peacefully sleeping wife and her rising-falling-rising belly before turning back to the balcony&rsquo;s ledge.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, the thing that kills me, really kills me, is the sameness of opposing sides, you know? If you don&rsquo;t then I envy you.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A minute ago, my bladder needed urgently to be relieved of its contents so I got up and tiptoed into the house so as to not wake up my wife because she finds it very difficult to go back to sleep these days. Watching my piss splash on the commode&rsquo;s white porcelain had a sobering effect on me. Who am I to be worrying about the larger problems of this world, using words like 'systemic'? I am just a respectable, domesticated, brown man who&rsquo;ll soon be stepping into the non-being existence of a parent.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could hear my wife&rsquo;s breaths when I bent down to pour myself a glass of water from the bedside and I avoided looking at her belly. I came out on the balcony again.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shadow of a Tulsi plant sways sleepily on Mr. Rao&rsquo;s terrace.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mrs. Rao comes up here every morning at 7 like clockwork. Even when she has had one of her bathroom-accidents the night before. She faces the sun and pours water out of a metal mug into the tulsi plant while murmuring her prayers. Once finished, she scrubs clean the pot in which the holy plant sits, and also sweeps the terrace for good measure.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, last week Mrs. Rao, the woman who loves her potted plant so dearly, had the tree in our street chopped down to a stump because the tree made it difficult for her to keep the house and the terrace clean, what with all the fallen leaves and rotting fruits it shed everywhere. There was a nest in the branches and when it fell down the yellow egg-yolk splattered on the hot pavement and sizzled like an omelet of sorts.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two birds and a tree less in the world because Mrs. Rao worries about cleanliness.

People keep inflicting their progeny upon this poor world as a way of rebelling against death&mdash;in some wooly corner of our heads we think that by birthing children we are creating carbon copies of ourselves which will continue to live on after us exactly the way we did.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each generation commits this folly, conveniently forgetting how much it prided itself on being so different from its previous generation, its Mothers and Fathers.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sameness of opposing sides.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what I do with my kid there is no way I won&rsquo;t fuck it up, no way I won&rsquo;t make some version of the same mistakes that my parents made.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife and I will either leave our child home to go watch the cinema, or we will stay home and count the sacrifices we are making for her sake.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will either raise her to be a respectable person and then spend the rest of my life trying not to look at her too hard, or I&rsquo;ll raise her to be an individualist and watch the world slowly dismantle her every which way.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She will either spend her nights sleepless on the balcony of an as-yet unconstructed house, or she will sleep peacefully and never be able to know what&rsquo;s that nagging anxiety in the pit of her stomach.</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</p></br><p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, I step on the ledge, once again I step back.

    description: "<div class=\"container\"><p>The day had been strange, and now it was night.</p></br><p>As she hurried on her way home, Simran passed beneath a streetlamp and could not repress a shudder at the sight of that Simran-shaped darkness which stretched from her feet to a few feet in front of her, that is to say, her shadow.</p></br><p>Her mind went back to how promisingly the day had begun.</p></br><p>At 9 in the morning, she had been standing on the balcony of a large apartment in South Delhi and the thought of landing her first job had filled her guts with excitement. Some of that excitement, admittedly, had started churning into nervousness when she rang the doorbell twice, and yet no one answered the door.</p></br><p>Maybe I&rsquo;m at the wrong address, she had thought, and to confirm it with Pandey-Ji she had taken out the pamphlet from her handbag on which his number was printed.</p></br><div class=\"gautam-story\"></br><p>Shadow Teacher<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;urgently needed.<br />Preference to fair, Hindu girl<br />with good English.<br />Experienced and Fresher both welcome.</p></br><p>Contact:<br />Mr. Purshottam Pandey (of the famous Pandey Halwayi<sup>2</sup>, Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi)<br />Ph: +91-9900289780</p></br></div></br><p>She had found the pamphlet stuck on an electric pole near her house and despite the fact that it sounded more like a ridiculous matrimonial ad than a call for a special-needs teacher, she had taken it off the pole and tucked it into her pocket.</p></br><p>The reason behind this pamphlet-stealing, ridiculousness-ignoring behavior was in part the utter boredom of her college vacations and in greater part the certification course she had done last year in Shadow Teaching. Until the pamphlet, no opportunity had presented itself for her to use what she had learned.</p></br><p>The next day, Simran had called Mr. Purshottam Pandey, and he had asked her, first, to call him Pandey-Ji like everyone else, and second, to show up at his house for an interview.</p></br><p>It was by the appointment thus fixed that she found herself today morning to be the ringer of unanswered doorbells.</p></br><p>Just as she was dialing his number, a boy&rsquo;s stammering voice rang out inside the house.</p></br><p>\"Mummy! So-so-someone&rsquo;s at th-the door.\"</p></br><p>A couple of minutes later, a woman, about 40 years of age, wrapped in a banarasi saree<sup>3</sup>, with a few henna-dyed strands of orange in her head, opened the door and smiled at Simran. \"Yes?\"</p></br><p>Simran held up the pamphlet to her. \"Good morning, ma&rsquo;am. I talked to Pandey-Ji on the phone the day before yesterday and he asked me to drop by for an interview.\"</p></br><p>\"Oh, yes, yes, yes. Simran. Yes, yes. Sonu&rsquo;s father told me. I hope you didn&rsquo;t have to wait long? We were just getting ready to leave for the shop&mdash;a big order for laddus<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;for minister sahab&rsquo;s house today came in just now,\" the woman shook Simran&rsquo;s outstretched hand and then introduced herself. \"I am Missus Pammi Pandey, by the way.\"</p></br><p>Simran took a step forward, expecting Mrs. Pandey to accept her inside the house, but Mrs. Pandey lingered on the doorway. \"You are so tall. Are you a model, by the way?\"</p></br><p>\"Thank you, Pammi-Ji. But no, I&rsquo;m not a model,\" Simran replied.</p></br><p>She was a little surprised at the abrupt and out-of-place question, but even more surprising was Mrs. Pandey&rsquo;s obvious disappointment about her not being a model.</p></br><p>\"But you are tall like a model. How tall are you exactly?\"</p></br><p>Simran wondered whether she should simply choose not to reply. But perhaps this was some strange way of conducting an interview?</p></br><p>\"5&rsquo;9,\" she said.</p></br><p>\"5&rsquo;9?\" Mrs. Pandey repeated after her, \"but that&rsquo;s certainly a model&rsquo;s height. Are you sure you are not a model, by the way?\"</p></br><p>\"Sure? Yes, of course, I am sure about what I am not.\"</p></br><p>\"Well, that&rsquo;s a pity. Anyway, don&rsquo;t just stand out there. Come on in, come in, by the way.\"</p></br><p>They entered the drawing-room and Simran sat down on a plush sofa. Mrs. Pandey got her a glass of water and then went back to fetch her husband.</p></br><p>The room had obviously been furnished by someone with a fair amount of money and no taste at all. Everything was of good quality, and none of it felt like it belonged.</p></br><p>The coffee table, for instance, was a minimalist all-glass affair, but the sofa-set around it had pink velvet covers.</p></br><p>Opposite to where she was sitting, an ivory statue of Ganesha, about 4-feet-high, stood next to a blue-lit gigantic aquarium that had too many fish, even for its great capacity. The fish kept bumping into each other, and into each other&rsquo;s shadow, as they wondered why the ocean had suddenly become so crowded.</p></br><p>The beautiful navy-blue curtain that Mrs. Pandey had drawn behind her while going inside, Simran noticed, was wrapped on one side around a pudgy little boy.</p></br><p>She said \"Hi\" but he only looked at her silently with his round-as-a-penny eyes.</p></br><p>\"What&rsquo;s your name?\" Simran tried again, but showing a Shakespearean nonchalance to this question, the boy turned to run away.</p></br><p>He collided, however, face first, into the enormous belly of his creator and reversed his course. Pandey-Ji entered the room with his son.</p></br><p>\"Namaste, Simran madam,\" he said with folded hands. His wife also came into the room and sat down next to him. Their son took his place in a corner with his nose almost touching the screen of an enormous phone he held in both his hands.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Namaste, Pandey-Ji. Here is my resume and my certification from the teaching course.&rdquo;</p></br><p>Pandey-Ji took the thin file Simran offered him and after a cursory glance at the documents it contained, he placed it on the coffee table. &ldquo;Your surname...Brahmin<sup>5</sup>?&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Yes. Punjabi Brahmin,&rdquo; Simran replied and Pandey-Ji seemed well-satisfied, but Mrs. Pandey decided to interject here with the line of conversation she considered too important to abandon in a hurry.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Do you see how tall she is? And still not a model, by the way,&rdquo; she said to her husband.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Pandey-Ji muttered as he scrolled something on his phone, &ldquo;Not a model? A teacher. Hah!&rdquo;</p></br><p>Mrs. Pandey shrugged her shoulders and shook her head vehemently.</p></br><p>They seemed to have forgotten that Simran was present in the same room.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; she said in an attempt to check this rather bewildering exchange, &ldquo;but can you please tell me how would you like me to help your son? We can start with speech-therapy right away to ease up his stammering, I think.&rdquo;</p></br><p>Pandey-Ji peered at her through sunken, small eyes. &ldquo;Help our Sonu?&rdquo; He pointed incredulously at his son with a thumb. &ldquo;This sack of potatoes? Oh no, no, no.&rdquo;</p></br><p>His wife gave a small chuckle and drew Sonu to her side. She fussed over the boy while he remained buried in his phone and gave her no attention whatsoever.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Can you please not call him that?&rdquo; Simran said coldly, feeling like the righteous champion of children everywhere. &ldquo;It could be really detrimental to his self-esteem.&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take offense, madam. Please,&rdquo; Pandey-Ji said, &ldquo;I only meant that it&rsquo;s my daughter I want you to teach, not my son. Sonu, go fetch your sister from her room.&rdquo;</p></br><p>Mr. and Mrs. Pandey waited silently for their children with Simran and she was glad they did not relapse into the subject of her not being a model despite having the height for it.</p></br><p>A couple of minutes later, Sonu came back and took his spot in a corner with his phone. His sister trailed behind him like a fat boy&rsquo;s thin girl shadow.</p></br><p>She looked like a sweet kid. Reminiscent of a certain Roald Dahl character, maybe. Lean. Almost as tall as her brother. Cocooned inside a sea-green frock. A finger between the pages of a book in her hand to serve as a bookmark. Her wide, curious eyes passed over her parents and settled on Simran.</p></br><p>&ldquo;This is our Rinky,&rdquo; Mrs. Pammi Pandey said, and tousled Rinky&rsquo;s neatly parted hair, an action that her daughter obviously found annoying.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Hello, Rinky.&rdquo; Simran shook hands with her. The girl&rsquo;s small hand felt warm against her own. Her eyes had not wavered yet from Simran&rsquo;s face.</p></br><p>Pandey-Ji got up from the sofa with a sigh. &ldquo;So, Simran madam. We are quite willing to hire you as a Shadow Teacher for Rinky. If it&rsquo;s alright by you, I mean?&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Yeah, but can you please explain a little as to what exactly I&rsquo;ll be helping Rinky with? We can talk in private if you want?&rdquo;</p></br><p>Pandey-Ji shuffled his considerable weight between his legs and exchanged a discomfited glance with his wife.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; he began.</p></br><p>But Mrs. Pandey interrupted him and addressed Simran affectionately, all regrets about her height&rsquo;s unrealized potential apparently forgotten for now.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do one thing, Simran beta. Why don&rsquo;t you spend the day with Rinky? You will get to know her problem by yourself, maybe? And the maid will come soon enough, so you can have lunch with the kids. What do you say, by the way?&rdquo;</p></br><p>The suggestion sounded sensible to Simran despite the infuriating source from whence it came. Shadow Teachers were generally advised to spend some time alone with the child for whom they were going to be responsible.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Sure, let&rsquo;s do that.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Pandey-Ji agreed, &ldquo;so, we&rsquo;ll see you in the evening. Then, you can tell us about how you are going to treat Rinky and we can also discuss your salary. Rinky, show madam your room, and Sonu&mdash;you keep an eye on the maid. Your mother says she stole some sugar last week.&rdquo;</p></br><p>They saw off Mr. and Mrs. Pandey. Then, Rinky took her hand and led her inside.</p></br><hr class=\"hr-small\" /></br><p>The first thing she noticed on entering Rinky&rsquo;s room were the books strewn everywhere from the table to the floor and peeking out of the half-open wardrobe. At a glance, she spotted&nbsp;<em>Matilda, Coraline, The Sleeper and the Spindle</em>, and some old copies of the Agatha Christie mysteries.</p></br><p>&ldquo;How old are you Rinky?&rdquo; Simran asked as she sat down on the bed and Rinky pulled up a chair beside her.</p></br><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be 8 next month.&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Ah, you will be a big girl then.&rdquo;</p></br><p>Rinky did not say anything to that.</p></br><p>Simran noticed a girl&rsquo;s photograph on the table and asked Rinky who it was.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s me. From last year,&rdquo; Rinky said.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Really? Well, I did not recognize you at all. You&mdash;well, you must have lost a lot of weight since then.&rdquo;</p></br><p>Rinky nodded her head bashfully. &ldquo;12 kilograms,&rdquo; she said.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Oh. Were you ill?&rdquo;</p></br><p>Rinky shook her head.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Then?&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Mummy said that girls should not be fat. Nobody likes them if they are fat and they can make no friends.&rdquo;</p></br><p>Simran felt revulsion bubble up inside her. She could imagine that sentence in Pammi Pandey&rsquo;s voice well enough. &ldquo;So you went on a diet?&rdquo;</p></br><p>Rinky nodded her head again.</p></br><p>Further conversation revealed that Rinky was doing great in school, she had topped the third grade recently, and while she was not very interested in sports, she took piano lessons every Friday.</p></br><p>They called Sonu from his room and the three of them played UNO while the maid prepared lunch for them. After lunch, Sonu went to his room for a nap and Simran sat down with Rinky to go through her schoolbooks.</p></br><p>As the sun went down, Simran was no closer to understanding why Mr. and Mrs. Pandey felt the need to hire a Shadow Teacher when their daughter was obviously excelling in everything it was possible for an 8-year-old to excel at.</p></br><p>She asked Sonu to call Mrs. Pandey and find out how long they were going to be.</p></br><p>The doorbell finally rang a little after 7 while she was watching old Tom and Jerry episodes with the children and Simran opened the door to admit their parents. Pandey-Ji asked her how her day had been and beamed when Simran told him she had loved spending time with his children.</p></br><p>&ldquo;So, shall we expect you to come and help Rinky from Monday? Let&rsquo;s fix your salary at 8 thousand for the first month and then we can see based on how things go, what do you say?&rdquo; he asked Simran a few minutes later as they sipped tea from ornate white china teacups.</p></br><p>&ldquo;That sounds okay to me, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;You want to switch to modeling, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mrs. Pandey offered.</p></br><p>Simran chose to ignore that.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Pandey-Ji, frankly speaking, I don&rsquo;t really understand how I can help Rinky. She is doing great at school, she has friends, she is polite. There are no &lsquo;special needs&rsquo;, as far as I can see. Do you want me to give her tuitions or something like that?&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;No, no, no, she already goes to the best coaching class in the city. It isn&rsquo;t about that,&rdquo; Pandey-Ji sighed and then turned to his wife. &ldquo;Shall we show it to her?&rdquo;</p></br><p>Mrs. Pandey bobbed her head up and down.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Okay, come out to the balcony then,&rdquo; Pandey-Ji said.</p></br><p>A few minutes later, Simran stood with the Pandey family outside their house. It had gotten dark, she saw, and she checked her watch pointedly to show that she should be on her way now.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Do you think you can do something about it then?&rdquo; Pandey-Ji asked.</p></br><p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t see it yet? Sonu, switch on the bulb.&rdquo;</p></br><p>A bulb was switched on in the balcony. Simran felt like she was at an exhibition and was failing to appreciate something that was obvious to everyone else around her.</p></br><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t know what you want to show me, Pandey-Ji.&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;That, of course,&rdquo; Pandey-Ji said in an exasperated voice and pointed at Rinky&rsquo;s feet.</p></br><p>Simran followed the trajectory of his finger but again failed to see what he was driving at. He sighed.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Her shadow. Look at her shadow.&rdquo;</p></br><p>And Simran saw.</p></br><p>In front of the little girl was stretched out her disproportionate shadow&mdash;the shadow of a much larger girl.</p></br><p>For a moment, Simran thought that it was a trick of the light, and she was about to say that when she began to realize that it wasn&rsquo;t as simple as that. For one thing, the Shadow Girl had a different hairstyle than Rinky. The ponytail she had in her photograph from last year. But also, the Shadow Girl was giving the finger to Mrs. Pammi Pandey even though Rinky stood unmoving with downcast eyes and both hands at her sides.</p></br><p>The bright girl with whom Simran had spent the day was almost completely gone now. In her place stood a helpless 8-year-old whose parents were displaying her like a circus freak that needed to be redeemed of its freakishness.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Well...what...I mean, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></br><p>The words in Simran&rsquo;s mind broke down and scattered into nothingness as she tried to voice them.</p></br><p>Looking at Rinky&rsquo;s shadow, now swaying side to side, now dancing to a silent song of its own, she felt as though the curtain on the world&rsquo;s backstage had been ripped apart and she was looking through the gaps at things supposed to remain unseen.</p></br><p>&ldquo;You&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;a Shadow Teacher, aren&rsquo;t you? So you must teach her to control her shadow, right?&rdquo; Mrs. Pandey asked her. She could hear the accusation in her voice.</p></br><p>Simran started to mumble something about that not being the meaning of the term but stopped as she realized how useless it would be to explain that.</p></br><p>&ldquo;Look, madam,&rdquo; Pandey-Ji said, &ldquo;we have already taken her to all manners of priests and doctors. Nothing seems to work. It wasn&rsquo;t so bad at first, but the girl&rsquo;s shadow seems to have become a person of its own now. A few weeks ago Sonu&rsquo;s school suggested hiring a Shadow Teacher for him but of course&nbsp;<em>he</em>&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t have a problem with his shadow, so we thought it would be better to hire one for his sister.&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Simran said, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t you think you could leave this thing alone? Maybe it will go away by itself just as it came?&rdquo;</p></br><p>Mrs. Pandey shook her head. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. News travels so fast in the community. In a few years when we are trying to marry Rinky people would still be asking about her&mdash;her abnormality&mdash;and God forbid if she is not cured by then&mdash;I can&rsquo;t imagine what her life would be like.&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Well, she is just a little kid. There&rsquo;s a lot of time until you have to think about all that, right?&rdquo;</p></br><p>Pandey-Ji looked at her with tired eyes and his small mouth grew smaller. &ldquo;So you can&rsquo;t help us?&rdquo;</p></br><p>Simran looked at Rinky again and shook her head. But as she turned to leave, the Shadow Girl had waved goodbye to her and Simran had waved back.</p></br><p>&ldquo;I will come again tomorrow, okay? I am not making any promises, but let&rsquo;s see if I can help,&rdquo; she had said to Pandey-Ji before leaving. She doubted she could do anything about the shadow, but maybe she could still be there for the girl to whom it was attached.</p></br><p>It had been a strange day indeed.</p></br><p>The light from the streetlamp faded out as Simran took a few more steps towards her house and her shadow melted back into the darkness.</p></br><p>At dinner, her brother asked her how the interview had gone and she told him that she was sure she had landed the job but she wasn&rsquo;t really sure where she had landed.</p></br><p>Later at night, in her bed, a thought behind her thoughts wondered what her shadow might do if one day it also decided to have a mind of its own. When she turned on her side did her shadow on the wall turn a moment sooner? Was its leg bent at the same angle as hers?</p></br><p>Before drifting off to sleep, she did the only sensible thing one can do if one is afraid of shadows, that is to say, she turned off the lights and closed her eyes.</p></br><hr class=\"hr-small\" /></br><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Shadow Teacher: An educational assistant who works directly with a single child with special needs during his/her early school years.</p></br><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Halwayi: A sweetshop owner.</p></br><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Banarasi saree: An expensive, gaudy saree usually reserved for special occasions.</p></br><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Laddu: A popular Indian sweet.</p></br><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Brahmin: As the highest caste in the Hindu caste-system, the traditional role of Brahmins was to teach.</p></br></div></br><hr class=\"hr\" /></br><div class=\"authors-information\"></br><h2 class=\"piece-title-subheading\">Bio</h2></br><div class=\"issues-text-small\"></br><p><strong>Aditya Gautam</strong>&nbsp;is an internationally published writer from India.

Contemporary Indian society, from a writer&rsquo;s perspective, is an infinitely interesting space for exploring the paradoxical nature of people. The aspiration of becoming \"modern\", for instance, moves parallel for most of the Indian upper-middle class with the aspiration of conforming as much as possible to the conventions held by their caste, community, society, or gender. Through this story, I have employed elements of magical-realism and absurd humor to focus on such contradictions and their coming to life, literally as well as figuratively.</p></br></div></br></div></br></div></br></div></br></div></br></div></br></div>"

      "The Peculiar Perils (and Excitements) of Living in One Language and Writing in Another",
    publication: "orca",
    Date: "",

    description:
      "<div style='' ><p>First things first: when I talk about the language in which we live, I mean to talk about the nebulous linguistic soup in our heads in which our thoughts are first formed and take definite shapes. This language, or a mixture of languages, is often our mother-tongue, the one in which people talk around us most often, the first language we learn to speak, and grow up speaking. It is, barring exceptional circumstances, the language in which a person would instinctively swear if a stiletto-wearing lady stepped on his toes. In most cases, it would also be the language in which one writes.</p></br><p>And yet, there are those, like me, who choose to write in a different language.</p></br><p>In recent years, I have begun to wonder why this is so, why I write in English instead of Hindi, my mother-tongue and the primary constituent of the linguistic ocean all around me. As a result of these musings, I have realized that the reasons behind this choice are many, some of them complex, others more complex, some rooted in the uniqueness of India&rsquo;s linguistic landscape, some in my individual person, and many in the overlapping area between these two.</p></br><p>One of the reasons, I believe, is what Geetanjali Shree, an internationally acclaimed Hindi writer, describes as the &ldquo;classic colonial condition&rdquo;. Put simply, it is the tendency of former British colonies, India among them, to hold the English language in higher esteem than their own language, the tendency to treat it as a metric of intelligence or sophistication.</p></br><p>In India, for instance, it is not uncommon for someone whose spoken English is not very good to be branded a&nbsp;<em>ganwaar</em>, an uncouth or provincial person, and good English speaking skills are a prerequisite to get into a decent college or land a decent job. There is a thriving industry of coaching institutes that help people cultivate the perfect American or British accents and parents are willing to lose a limb to get their kids into English-medium schools. These schools insist that the students only speak in English on their premises and stock their libraries exclusively with English literature. So the English language continues to bask here in a glow of class-climbing, caste-escaping aspirations, and promises its devotees an entry pass to the &ldquo;equal-opportunity&rdquo; club.</p></br><p>At this point, if you are beginning to imagine some sort of pitched struggle between a global and a native language, please don&rsquo;t. The reality, as usual, is much more nuanced than it looks.</p></br><p>For one thing, unlike most other countries, India doesn&rsquo;t have a national language that is spoken and understood by a vast majority. Instead, we have more than 1900 languages and dialects spoken all over the country by a population of more than a billion people.&nbsp;<em>Kos-kos par badle paani, chaar kos par baani</em>, goes a popular saying, flaunting, with very little exaggeration, the change in the taste of water and the language spoken every couple of miles in India. Even when I call Hindi my mother-tongue, I refer to one of the many Hindis (it has forty-eight officially recognized dialects) mixed with Urdu, English, and a little bit of Farsi, which is spoken in my hometown.</p></br><p>In this poetically insane medley, English acts as a linguistic glue of sorts.</p></br><p>As one of the two official languages of India, along with Hindi, it is the language of our higher education, the national media houses, the higher bureaucracy, and the judiciary. It may not be the mother tongue of most people in India, nor the language in which they live, but it is certainly our language of necessity and convenience, the one that people from opposite ends of the country use to communicate with each other.</p></br><p>As a kid growing up in a small religious town (only a few dozen miles from Rishikesh, where the Beatles famously found their&nbsp;<em>nirvana</em>), my school&rsquo;s bookshelf suffered acutely from a case of the &ldquo;classic colonial condition&rdquo;. For me, therefore, English became the language of stories that could instantaneously transport me to places real and more-than-real, away from boredom. The heroes of my childhood were the characters created by Enid Blyton, J.K Rowling, C.S Lewis, Mark Twain, instead of the Indian folk heroes whose stories reached me only on the nights, usually at family weddings, when some old relative was feeling particularly sleepless.</p></br><p>At some point during these early years when my ravenous hunger for stories lost a millionth part of its intensity, a part of my reading self began to conceive of someone, a real person, creating the worlds I visited between the covers of books. Naturally, I longed, in a vague sort of way, to be that person. I longed, therefore, to be Blyton, Rowling, Lewis, and Twain. All of whom, incidentally, wrote in English.</p></br><p>No big surprise then that I made the same choice. We write what we read, after all, to tweak Ludwig Feuerbach&rsquo;s famous phrase a little. In the beginning, at least.</p></br><p>I think now, with a lingering sense of loss, of the first story I ever wrote.</p></br><p>I must have been ten or eleven years old because vampires were still cool back then, courtesy of the&nbsp;<em>Twilight</em>&nbsp;book series. As were the werewolves, of course. Both featured in my story, with all their tropes intact. That might have still turned out okay, except for the fact that all my characters sounded more or less alike, and there was little by way of originality in plot or structure. More importantly, even though I had intended to set this story in my hometown, the only resemblance between the real and fictional town turned out to be a shared name. The story&rsquo;s town felt more like the kind of countryside towns and villages where Enid Blyton usually set her Famous Five novels; my characters had Earl Grey tea in the evening, unlike the people of my hometown who have always been happy with their regular ginger-and-cardamom&nbsp;<em>chai</em>. They called each other &ldquo;dear&rdquo; and insisted on having some Scotch before going to bed.</p></br><p>Aspects of this experience may be common to most writers who dip their toes into fictional waters at a tender age, and like many of them who stick to writing for the sheer joy of it (despite the voice in their heads telling them what abject failures they are at it), the plots and structures of my stories also got better with time. Some things, however, remained as unresolved as for that very first story&mdash;a sense of missing crucial details in my characters and their settings. The world of my fiction, rendered in the English language, was too&nbsp;<em>clean</em>, too well-organized. Despite honest plots, it fell short of reflecting the messy, noisy, crowded world I lived in, the world whose stories I wanted to tell.</p></br><p>For as long as I have been writing, I have carried this feeling of losing essential details, the feeling of writing against an invisible filter between the world of my stories and myself. It has taken me a fair amount of time to be able to articulate this, and only recently have I have begun to understand that the nature of this perceived filter is that of translational loss.</p></br><p>Translation, the way I understand it, is an alchemical process. The translator does not merely transport some stories from foreign languages to our language, he actually teleports an alien world to ours while balancing the two paradoxical goals of preserving this alienness in all its strange beauty and making it possible for us to comprehend this beauty. When I write in English, I do something similar. Only, instead of someone else&rsquo;s literature, I am translating the language of my being, and when I try to replace this language with another, I can preserve my plot but many other less tangible things are lost. This happens because language is not merely a mode of communicating the story to the readers. It pervades everything from the personalities of our characters to the architecture of our narratives. The way a typical man from the state of Uttar Pradesh in India speaks, for example, when translated to the Queen&rsquo;s English would lose almost all its character, all its spice<em>.&nbsp;</em>The abuses with which he peppers each sentence, the obsequious way in which he deals with his boss, the way he is with his wife in bed, all of it, when passed through a filter of &ldquo;clean&rdquo; English would turn drab and ill-fitting.</p></br><p>The key to avoiding this, for me, has been the recognition that my in-head process of translation needs not to replace one language with another but to weave together both of them. Some things will still be lost, since there is no such thing as lossless translation, but it is the kind of loss with which I can make my peace because the product of this combinational translation is neither inferior nor superior to the original.</p></br><p>It is its own independent, beautiful thing&mdash;an alien world superimposed on the familiar, neither native nor foreign. To be able to do this, what we need, paradoxically enough, is to actively stop thinking about language and declare our allegiance first and foremost to our stories and their characters. When we do that, we are able to transcend translation, wrap up the languages in one another, and use them in a way that is most honest to our stories.</p></br><p>Salman Rushdie, for example, does this in many of his novels by interlacing English with HUG-ME (Rushdie&rsquo;s acronym for the mix of Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi, and English that is the language of Mumbai, the language he grew up with) because that is the language of his characters and the places where they live. &lsquo;But what is so precious&rsquo;, says a character in&nbsp;<em>Midnight&rsquo;s Children,&nbsp;</em>&lsquo;to need all this writing-<em>shiting</em>?&rsquo; The word &ldquo;<em>shiting</em>&rdquo; here referring to a typical Indian mannerism of highlighting an English word of a sentence by succeeding it with a rhyming word that is by itself nonsensical.</p></br><p>By attempting to put my understanding of this pre-writing translation to practice, I have also realized that the self-assurance needed to construct my own frame of translation can only come from trusting my readers. Trusting them to take the language and understand it by the context of the story. Trusting them to not balk at the first thing they find foreign and have to Google. Trusting them, instead, to love that foreignness and the literary engagement it provides them.</p></br><p>Rushdie, after all, trusted his readers to not confuse &ldquo;shiting&rdquo; with &ldquo;shitting&rdquo;.</p></br><p>All said and done, I know that like most things about fiction writing, there is no right or wrong way of walking back and forth on the tightrope bridge between languages. No formula that I can apply to the language of my experience and memory for translating it to the language of the words on my paper, and no precedents I can blindly follow. Every other writer who has done this has done it by finding a way of using languages that was best-suited to their unique voice and identity, and I will have to do the same.</p></br><p>Meanwhile, the excitements of living in one language and writing in another continue to lie in the perils of doing so, and in the peculiar, sometimes beautiful results that come up as I try to merge the two. And what about the days when the perils feel like too high a price for the excitements, and I find myself wondering if it would not be better to give up all these linguistic nuances and fully embrace a language once and for all? Well, on those days I try to remember an interesting anecdote that Arundhati Roy, a master tightrope walker herself, recounted in her&nbsp;<em>W. G. Sebald Lecture on Literary Translation.</em></p></br><p>A few weeks after the release of her Booker-winning novel,&nbsp;<em>The God of Small Things</em>, a rather hostile member of the audience asked Roy a question during a book reading: &ldquo;Has any writer ever written a masterpiece in an alien language? In a language other than his mother tongue?&rdquo;</p></br><p>&ldquo;Nabokov&rdquo;, she replied, and sent the man storming out of the hall.</p> </div> ",

    title: "In Defense Of Moonlighting",
    publication: "Businessworld",
    Date: "2 March, 2023",
    description:
      "<p>If a Martian were to visit our planet and ask you to describe what is this 'job' thing you keep talking about, you would probably describe it as a setup in which you use your skills to do a specific task for someone and get paid for that. The definition is sound enough, even if it leaves something to be desired in terms of nuance, but you are talking to aliens here and hoping that they don&rsquo;t get irritated by long explanations and shoot you down with laser beams.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Now, let&rsquo;s return from celestial thought experiments to reality. The year 2023, almost 3 years of coping with the pandemic and its fallout in different aspects of our lives, a war raging once again in Europe, fanaticism of all sorts creeping out of its hideyholes around the world, a global recession looming overhead as tech giants such as Meta, Google, Twitter and many others fire employees by the thousands and an AI chatbot telling people it loves them and wants access to nuclear codes even as it puts red flags over millions of jobs. Amidst all this, a word keeps coming up regularly in the headlines. Moonlighting.</p></br><p>For the unfamiliar, moonlighting is the practice of a person holding two or more jobs at the same time, without disclosing this to his employers. While professionals in other industries may also be experimenting with it, currently most of the focus is on the IT industry which has a great number of people working from home (means) and offers some of the most lucrative jobs (motive). Armed with the means and the motive, many IT employees are choosing to moonlight and earn as much as they can, while they still can.&nbsp;</p></br><p>But, to put it mildly, industry titans are not fond of the idea. Rishad Premji, Wipro's chairman, has called it 'cheating - plain and simple' and Ramachandran Sundararajan, Chief People Officer at HCL Tech has said, &ldquo;We do not approve of that.&rdquo; Many of their contemporaries have expressed similar views, including Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy.&nbsp;</p></br><p>\"My fervent desire and humble desire to youngsters is please don't fall into this trap of I will moonlight, I will do work from home, I will come to office three days in a week,\" Murthy said during an event last week.&nbsp;</p></br><p>While there is a legal aspect to the matter, most of the criticism about moonlighting seems to be based on rather slippery concepts, loyalty and ethics. When Premji calls it 'cheating', he sounds like a jilted lover and when Narayana Murthy talks about the 'trap', he invokes a worried grandparent advising the 'youngsters' not to stray from the good path. Nothing wrong with that per se, loyalty and ethics are appreciable, necessary things, yet one cannot help but feel some apprehension when they are cited by people who have amassed billions as the result of an economic system that puts the maximisation of profits over everything else.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Moreover, if you told your Martian friend all this and then had it go through the newsfeed, chances are it would be utterly baffled by the one-sidedness of the values that business leaders profess to value so much.</p></br><p>For instance, while it is unethical and disloyal of employees to work two jobs, independent directors at any IT firm are allowed to run other businesses and be independent directors in up to seven public firms and many more private firms. Elon Musk, the poster boy of toxic work culture, did exactly that when he took over as the CEO at Twitter while also being the CEO at Tesla. He also fired 50 per cent of Twitter&rsquo;s employees when he came on board - loyal and ethical employees with families to feed, bills to pay, loans to honour. Did that attract the same amount of hand-wringing as moonlighting does? Of course not. People getting fired isn&rsquo;t very much out of the ordinary and our capitalist heroes and masters live by simple credos: employees are expendable, businesses are not and all employees are equal, but some are more equal than others.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Earlier last week, Moneycontrol reported that Wipro, led by Rishad Premji, cut down its salary offers to freshers. The candidates who had already received offers of Rs 6.5 lakh per annum and were waiting to join the company received emails from Wipro, asking if they would like to join at Rs 3.5 LPA. Wipro is not a loss-making company - it reported a net profit of Rs 3,052.9 crore for the quarter that ended December 2022 (Q3FY23) and the Premji family is worth over $19 billion. Many candidates must have rejected other offers to accept Wipro&rsquo;s and would now have to accept the reduced offer with a monthly salary of 25-30 thousand per month. The company has been offering the same package for years now and doesn&rsquo;t seem to understand the concept of inflation and corresponding salary adjustment. Another interesting statistic: IT CEOs' salaries increased by 1,500 per cent while freshers' salaries went up only 50 per cent in the last 10 years at Infosys, Wipro and TCS, according to Business Today. Yet, it is 'cheating- plain and simple' if employees want to supplement their income with another job.&nbsp;</p></br><p>Benevolent thoughts of saving youngsters from traps such as moonlighting (read more money) and WFH (read more convenience) must also come rather quickly, we can imagine, when one has an estimated net worth of $4.5 billion and the UK&rsquo;s Prime Minister as his son-in-law. You must wonder, however and your Martian friend might as well, whether these concerns about youngsters would hold if an opportunity to significantly cut the cost of human resource presented itself in the form of, say, artificial intelligence. Another IT leader, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna, has admitted just this month that it would be a 'good thing' if AI could replace 'clerical white-collar jobs'. Narayana Murthy and others have also expressed similarly favorable views about the technology.</p></br><p>In another age and time, the status quo reinforced by employers through their actions and words would have been taken for granted. The young workforce, the millennials and zoomers, currently employed in the IT industry, however, is justifiably skeptical - cynical, even - about the concepts of loyalty or work ethic as defined by their employers. They are not people whose self-worth is tied up with their performance reviews, they don&rsquo;t live for a pat on the back from the boss and if they have discovered ways to make more money with their skills then they are not going to give it all up with a smile. For a while, they may be restricted by legal technicalities, but laws can change for the majoritarian view and it&rsquo;s improbable that we will ever be going back to pre-pandemic work culture.&nbsp;</p></br><p>As for ethical and moral dilemmas, employees are not losing much sleep over them. &ldquo;If a company cannot judge by my performance whether I am holding one job at a time, or two, or ten, then they have no right to tell me that I am cheating on them&rdquo;, says a 28-year-old moonlighting friend when asked about the burden on his conscience. He does, however, add a caveat about not indulging in malpractices such as data theft or strategy leakage while moonlighting.&nbsp;</p></br><p>So the old boys can whine all they want, but the times they are a-changin&rsquo; and it may save them a lot of misery if they accept this.&nbsp;</p></br><p>&nbsp;</p></br><p>&nbsp;</p></br><div>&nbsp;</div>"
